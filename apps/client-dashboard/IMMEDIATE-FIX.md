# Immediate Fix Deployed

## What I Fixed

1. **Added Comprehensive Edge Function Logging**
   - Now logs every step of authentication
   - Shows if JWT is present and valid
   - Shows which tables are being checked
   - Shows tenant resolution process

2. **Fixed Silent Error Swallowing**
   - Errors are now logged instead of silently caught
   - You'll see exactly what's failing

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Try to Make a Booking
Go to your dashboard and try to create a booking again.

### Step 2: Check Edge Function Logs

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz/functions
2. Click on `widget-booking-live`
3. Click on "Logs" tab
4. Look for the most recent request

### Step 3: Look for These Specific Log Lines

You should see something like:
```
[request-id] Attempting auth fallback (no widget token)
[request-id] Bearer token present: true Length: 500+
[request-id] User found: true User ID: xxx
[request-id] Using explicit tenant_id from request: f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479
[request-id] Tenant resolved: true Name: Demo Restaurant
[request-id] Final auth resolution: { resolvedTenantId: '...', source: 'user_jwt' }
```

**If you see:**
- ` Bearer token present: false` → Frontend isn't sending JWT
- `User found: false` → JWT is invalid or expired
- `Auth error: ...` → Specific auth problem
- `Final auth resolution: { ...resolvedTenantId: null }` → Couldn't resolve tenant

### Step 4: Share the Logs

Copy the entire log output for the failed request and share it with me.

## Most Likely Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: No User JWT Being Sent

**Symptoms:** `Bearer token present: false` or `No bearer token`

**Fix:** The frontend `getUserAccessToken()` function isn't finding the JWT.

**Test in browser console:**
```javascript
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
console.log('Session:', data.session);
console.log('Access token:', data.session?.access_token?.substring(0, 30));
```

If no session → **User isn't logged in to dashboard**

### Issue 2: Tables Don't Exist

**Symptoms:** 
```
user_tenant_access error (table may not exist)
auto_provisioning error (table may not exist)  
Resolved from user_tenant_access: null
Resolved from auto_provisioning: null
```

**This is OK** - it means the edge function tried these tables but they don't exist. That's fine because the frontend explicitly passes `tenant_id`.

**What matters:** Does it log `Using explicit tenant_id from request: ...`?

If YES → Should work!
If NO → Frontend not passing tenant_id

### Issue 3: Frontend Not Passing tenant_id

**Symptoms:** No log line about "explicit tenant_id from request"

**Check ConfirmationStep.tsx line 146:**
```typescript
const confirmationData: any = {
  tenant_id: tenant.tenant_id,  // ← Is this defined?
  hold_id: hold.hold_id,
  guest_details,
};
```

**Browser console should show:**
```
[ConfirmationStep] Final confirmation data: { tenant_id: '...', ... }
```

## Quick Test Command

Run this to verify the system still works with token auth:
```bash
node test-booking-flow.mjs
```

This should still pass - proving the edge function logic is sound.

## Alternative: Direct Database Insert

If the JWT auth continues to fail, we can bypass the edge function for dashboard bookings:

```typescript
// Instead of calling confirmReservation(), do this:
const { data: booking, error } = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .insert({
    tenant_id: tenant.tenant_id,
    booking_time: selected_slot.time,
    party_size: party_size,
    guest_name: guest_details.name,
    guest_email: guest_details.email,
    guest_phone: guest_details.phone,
    status: 'pending',
    duration_minutes: 120,
    deposit_required: false,
    deposit_amount: 0,
    deposit_paid: false
  })
  .select()
  .single();

if (error) throw error;

return {
  reservation_id: booking.id,
  confirmation_number: `PEND${booking.id.slice(-6).toUpperCase()}`,
  status: 'pending',
  summary: {
    date: booking.booking_time,
    time: new Date(booking.booking_time).toLocaleTimeString('en-US', {
      hour: 'numeric',
      minute: '2-digit',
      hour12: true
    }),
    party_size: booking.party_size,
    table_info: 'Pending approval',
    deposit_required: false,
    deposit_amount: 0
  }
};
```

But let's see the logs first!

**Status:** Enhanced logging deployed  
**Action Required:** Try booking + share edge function logs  
**ETA:** 5 minutes to identify and fix once logs are seen
