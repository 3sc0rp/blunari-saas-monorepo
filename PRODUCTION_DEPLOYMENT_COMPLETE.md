## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Watch

**Database Queries (Run in SQL Editor):**

```sql
-- Check notification reads activity
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as reads_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM notification_reads 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Check invitation acceptance rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_invitations,
  COUNT(accepted_at) as accepted,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN accepted_at IS NULL AND expires_at > NOW() THEN 1 END) as pending,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN accepted_at IS NULL AND expires_at <= NOW() THEN 1 END) as expired,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(accepted_at) / COUNT(*), 1) as acceptance_rate_pct
FROM employee_invitations;

-- Check active employees by role
SELECT 
  role,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN last_login > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 1 END) as active_last_7d
FROM employees 
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
GROUP BY role
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Edge Function Logs:**
```bash
# View invite-staff logs
npx supabase functions logs invite-staff --project-ref kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz

# View accept-staff-invitation logs
npx supabase functions logs accept-staff-invitation --project-ref kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz
```

**Supabase Dashboard:**

- Check: Database â†’ Tables â†’ notification_reads
- Check: Edge Functions â†’ Logs
- Check: Auth â†’ Users (new staff accounts)

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Invitation email not received"
**Solutions:**
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Check edge function logs for errors
3. Verify email address is correct
4. Check SMTP settings in secrets
5. Test with a different email provider

**Quick Fix:**
```sql
-- Get invitation link manually
SELECT 
  email,
  'https://admin.blunari.ai/accept-invitation?token=' || invitation_token as link,
  expires_at
FROM employee_invitations 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Issue: "Invitation link expired"
**Solution:** Send a new invitation - tokens expire after 7 days

### Issue: "Cannot accept invitation - already an employee"
**Solution:** User already has an account. Have them sign in at https://admin.blunari.ai

### Issue: "Notifications not syncing across devices"
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify user is authenticated on both devices
3. Check `notification_reads` table has entries
4. Try marking a new notification as read
