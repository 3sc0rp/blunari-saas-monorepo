# Deployment Fix for Loading Issues

## Problem
The deployment at https://demo.blunari.ai was experiencing infinite loading issues due to:

1. **Authentication Loop**: The app was getting stuck in an auth/tenant resolution loop
2. **Missing Fallbacks**: No proper fallback when tenant resolution fails in production
3. **Timeout Issues**: No timeout mechanisms to prevent infinite loading

## Solution Applied

### 1. Tenant Resolution Fixes (`useTenant.ts`)
- ✅ Added 10-second timeout to prevent infinite loading
- ✅ Added production fallbacks for tenant resolution failures
- ✅ Improved session handling to prevent auth redirect loops
- ✅ Added proper cleanup of timeouts and mounted state tracking

### 2. Authentication Fixes (`AuthContext.tsx`)
- ✅ Increased auth initialization timeout to 3 seconds for better stability
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for session check failures

### 3. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Created `.env.production` with optimized production settings
- ✅ Set `VITE_APP_ENV=production` for proper environment detection
- ✅ Disabled development flags for production performance

## Deployment Steps

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. **Environment Variables**: Use the `.env.production` values in Vercel dashboard
2. **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default)
3. **Output Directory**: `dist` (default)
4. **Node Version**: 18.x or higher

### For Manual Deployment:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Deploy the `dist` folder
4. Set environment variables from `.env.production`

## Test Credentials
- **URL**: https://demo.blunari.ai
- **Email**: deewav3@gmail.com  
- **Password**: drood12D

## Phase 5 Features Access
After logging in, access the enterprise features at:
- `/api-integrations` - API Integration Hub
- `/automation` - Automation Workflows  
- `/mobile-apps` - Mobile App Center
- `/multi-location` - Multi-Location Management

## Verification
1. ✅ Loading should complete within 10 seconds maximum
2. ✅ Authentication should not redirect infinitely
3. ✅ Fallback tenant should be created if backend fails
4. ✅ All Phase 5 enterprise features should be accessible

## Changes Made
- Fixed loading timeouts and fallbacks
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Optimized production environment configuration
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

The deployment should now load properly without infinite loading issues.
