```powershell
# Test XSS protection
# Try entering this in any text field: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
# Expected: Stripped before submission

# Test auto-save
# 1. Fill form halfway
# 2. Reload page
# 3. Should see "Saved Draft Found" notification

# Test validation
# Email: test@invalid
# Expected: "Please enter a valid email address"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Draft not saving
**Check:** Browser localStorage enabled  
**Fix:** Test in incognito mode (localStorage may be disabled)

### Issue: Validation errors not showing
**Check:** Browser console for errors  
**Fix:** Verify Yup schemas imported correctly

### Issue: Form submits with invalid data
**Check:** `handleOrderSubmit()` calls `sanitizeOrderForm()`  
**Fix:** Ensure validation completes before submission

### Issue: ARIA labels not working
**Check:** Screen reader settings (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver)  
**Fix:** Verify `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` attributes present
