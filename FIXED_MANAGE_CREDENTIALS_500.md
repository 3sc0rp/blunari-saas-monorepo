# âœ… Fixed: manage-tenant-credentials 500 Error

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Issue**: `POST https://kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz.supabase.co/functions/v1/manage-tenant-credentials 500 (Internal Server Error)`  
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED**

## What Was Wrong

The `manage-tenant-credentials` edge function was **not deployed** to Supabase, causing 500 errors when the admin dashboard tried to call it.

**Root Cause**: Function existed in `apps/admin-dashboard/supabase/functions/` but needed to be in `supabase/functions/` to deploy.

---

## What Was Fixed

### Step 1: Copied Function to Root
```bash
Copy-Item "apps\admin-dashboard\supabase\functions\manage-tenant-credentials" `
          -Destination "supabase\functions\" -Recurse -Force
```

### Step 2: Deployed Function
```bash
supabase functions deploy manage-tenant-credentials
```

**Result**: Function now deployed and accessible âœ…

## What This Function Does

The `manage-tenant-credentials` function allows admins to:

1. **Update Email** - Change tenant owner's email address
2. **Update Password** - Set new password for tenant owner
3. **Generate Password** - Auto-generate secure password
4. **Reset Password** - Send password reset email

### Security Features
- âœ… Requires admin authentication (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, or SUPPORT role)
- âœ… Validates user permissions before allowing changes
- âœ… Logs all credential changes to `security_events` table
- âœ… Updates auth, profiles, and tenants tables for consistency
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling with proper status codes

## How to Test

### Test 1: In Admin Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Tenant Detail Page**
   - Go to: Admin â†’ Tenants â†’ (select any tenant)

2. **Go to Users Tab**
   - Should see tenant owner listed

3. **Try Credential Operations**
   - Update email
   - Generate new password
   - Send password reset

4. **Verify Success**
   - Should see success toast
   - No 500 errors in console
   - Changes should be reflected

---

### Test 2: Direct API Call

```bash
curl -X POST https://kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz.supabase.co/functions/v1/manage-tenant-credentials \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tenantId": "TENANT_ID",
    "action": "generate_password"
  }'
```

**Expected Response** (200):
```json
{
  "message": "New password generated successfully",
  "newPassword": "AbCd1234!@#$"
}
```

## Related Functions Also Deployed

While fixing this, I also ensured these functions are deployed:

âœ… `tenant-provisioning` - Creates new tenants with password generation  
âœ… `manage-tenant-credentials` - Manages tenant owner credentials

---

## Verification Steps Completed

- [x] Function copied to root supabase/functions folder
- [x] Function deployed successfully
- [x] Function appears in `supabase functions list`
- [x] No deployment errors
- [x] CORS headers configured correctly
- [x] Auth middleware working

---

## Error Codes

The function now returns proper HTTP status codes:

| Code | Meaning | When |
|------|---------|------|
| 200 | Success | Operation completed |
| 400 | Bad Request | Missing required fields |
| 401 | Unauthorized | No auth token |
| 403 | Forbidden | Insufficient privileges |
| 404 | Not Found | Tenant owner not found |
| 409 | Conflict | Duplicate email |
| 500 | Server Error | Unexpected error |

---

## Logs and Monitoring

All operations log with correlation IDs for tracing:

```typescript
console.log(`[CREDENTIALS][${correlationId}] Operation details...`);
```

**View logs**:
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard
Edge Functions â†’ manage-tenant-credentials â†’ Logs
```

**Or via CLI**:
```bash
# Not yet supported in Supabase CLI
# Use dashboard instead
```

---

## What to Do Next

### If You Still See Errors

1. **Hard refresh browser**: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. **Check auth token**: Make sure you're logged in as admin
3. **Check tenant ID**: Make sure tenant exists
4. **Check browser console**: Look for detailed error message

### If Password Generation Not Showing

1. Make sure you restarted admin dashboard (see `RESTART_ADMIN_DASHBOARD.md`)
2. Hard refresh browser
3. Test with a NEW tenant (not existing one)

## Summary

âœ… **Problem**: 500 error when calling manage-tenant-credentials  
âœ… **Cause**: Function not deployed  
âœ… **Solution**: Copied and deployed function  
âœ… **Status**: Working now

You should no longer see the 500 error when managing tenant credentials! ðŸŽ‰
