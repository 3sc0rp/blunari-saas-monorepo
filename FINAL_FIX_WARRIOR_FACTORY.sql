-- FINAL FIX for Warrior Factory
-- Current state: tenant email = addictedave@gmail.com, owner = naturevillage2024@gmail.com
-- Goal: Keep addictedave@gmail.com and sync the owner to match

-- Step 1: Tenant email is already addictedave@gmail.com (no change needed)
-- Just verifying current state
SELECT 
  'Current state (before fix)' as status,
  t.email as tenant_email,
  u.email as owner_email,
  'Emails do not match!' as issue
FROM tenants t
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = t.owner_id
WHERE t.name = 'Warrior Factory';

-- Step 2: Delete the old auto_provisioning record (points to wrong user)
DELETE FROM auto_provisioning 
WHERE tenant_id = (SELECT id FROM tenants WHERE name = 'Warrior Factory');

-- Step 3: Verify everything is ready
SELECT 
  'âœ… Ready for new owner creation' as status,
  t.id as tenant_id,
  t.name,
  t.email as tenant_email,
  t.owner_id as old_owner_id,
  u.email as old_owner_email,
  'Will create owner with addictedave@gmail.com' as note
FROM tenants t
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = t.owner_id
WHERE t.name = 'Warrior Factory';
