-- CHECK ADMIN vs TENANT USER SEPARATION
-- =============================================================================
-- This query shows the difference between admin users and tenant owners

-- Part 1: Show admin users (from employees table)
SELECT 
  'ADMIN USER' as user_type,
  e.user_id,
  au.email,
  e.role::text as role,
  'N/A - No tenant link' as tenant_info,
  e.status
FROM employees e
JOIN auth.users au ON au.id = e.user_id
WHERE e.status = 'ACTIVE'
ORDER BY au.email;

-- Part 2: Show tenant owners (from tenants table)
SELECT 
  'TENANT OWNER' as user_type,
  t.owner_id as user_id,
  au.email,
  p.role as role,
  t.name as tenant_info,
  'active' as status
FROM tenants t
LEFT JOIN auth.users au ON au.id = t.owner_id
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON p.user_id = t.owner_id
WHERE t.owner_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY au.email;

-- Part 3: Check for tenants WITHOUT owners (need to be fixed)
SELECT

  t.id as tenant_id,
  t.name as tenant_name,
  t.email as tenant_email,
  t.owner_id,

FROM tenants t
WHERE t.owner_id IS NULL;

-- Part 4: Check for tenants linked to ADMIN users (BAD!)
SELECT

  t.id as tenant_id,
  t.name as tenant_name,
  t.owner_id,
  au.email as admin_email,

  'CRITICAL: Remove this link!' as action_needed
FROM tenants t
JOIN auth.users au ON au.id = t.owner_id
JOIN employees e ON e.user_id = t.owner_id
WHERE e.status = 'ACTIVE';

-- Part 5: Check auto_provisioning for admin users (BAD!)
SELECT

  t.name as tenant_name,
