### Step 3: Quick Smoke Test

**Create a Per-Tray Package**:

1. Click **"Per Tray"** card
2. Fill in:
   - Name: "Test Tray Package"
   - Price: $80
   - Tray Sizing: "Serves 10 people" (dropdown)
   - Min Trays: 2
   - Max Trays: 10
3. Click **"Save Package"**

**Expected**:
- ✅ Toast: "Package created successfully"
- ✅ Package appears in list
- ✅ No errors in console

---

### Step 4: If It Works ✅

**You're ready to go!** The form is production-ready.

Next steps:
1. Create real packages with actual pricing
2. Test widget order flow (customers placing orders)
3. Mark todo items complete

### Step 5: If Something's Wrong ❌

**Common Issues**:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "I see the old basic form" | Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` |
| "Dialog doesn't open" | Check browser console for errors |
| "Deployment still building" | Wait 2-4 more minutes |
| "Form looks broken" | Clear browser cache, try incognito |

**Get Help**:
