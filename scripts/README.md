# Widget Booking Direct API Test

This HTML file provides a standalone test environment for the widget booking system.

## Usage

1. Open `test-widget-booking-direct.html` in your browser directly:
   ```
   file:///c:/Users/Drood/Desktop/Blunari%20SAAS/scripts/test-widget-booking-direct.html
   ```

2. Click "Run Complete Flow" or test each step individually

3. Watch the console logs and on-screen output to see exactly what data the API returns

## What It Tests

1. **Token Creation** - Creates a widget authentication token
2. **Hold Creation** - Creates a booking hold with a time slot
3. **Reservation Confirmation** - Confirms the reservation and creates the booking

## Why This Helps

- **No Cache**: Bypasses React build cache completely
- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML/JavaScript, runs anywhere
- **Detailed Logging**: Shows every API call and response
- **Field Validation**: Checks if all required fields are present

## Expected Result

When the flow completes, you should see:

```
‚úÖ RESERVATION CREATED
‚úÖ Reservation ID: [UUID]
‚úÖ Confirmation #: PEND[...]
‚úÖ Status: pending
‚úÖ Party Size: 2

üîç FIELD VALIDATION:
  ‚úÖ reservation_id: PRESENT
  ‚úÖ confirmation_number: PRESENT
  ‚úÖ status: PRESENT
  ‚úÖ summary: PRESENT
```

If any fields show as "‚ùå MISSING", that indicates the exact problem with the API.

## Comparison with UI

Since this test works perfectly (confirmed by our Node.js test), but the UI fails, the issue is in:
- How the React app processes the response
- Browser cache serving old code
- Response parsing in the booking-proxy.ts

## Solutions

1. **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R) after deploying new code
2. **Check browser console** for the new debug logs we added
3. **Compare** the response shown in this test vs what the browser console shows
