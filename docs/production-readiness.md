## ðŸ“Š Data Flow Verification

### Widget â†’ Database
1. Customer fills booking form
2. Data validated client-side
3. Sent to `widget-booking-live` edge function
4. Creates booking with `pending` status
5. Notification email sent to restaurant
6. Customer receives confirmation email

### Command Center â†’ Status Updates
1. Admin reviews pending booking
2. Clicks approve/decline in dashboard
3. Calls `reservation-status` edge function
4. Updates booking status in database
5. Customer notification email sent
6. Real-time dashboard update

### Real-time Data Flow
1. Database change occurs
2. Supabase real-time event triggered
3. Client subscription receives update
4. React Query cache invalidated
5. UI automatically refreshes
6. Metrics recalculated

## ðŸ§ª Production Test Scenarios

### Booking Creation Flow
```bash
# Test widget booking
1. Fill out booking form on widget
2. Submit booking
3. Verify pending status in dashboard
4. Check customer email received
5. Check admin notification sent
```

### Approval Workflow
```bash
# Test reservation approval
1. Open pending booking in command center
2. Click "Approve" button
3. Verify status updates to "confirmed"
4. Check customer approval email
5. Verify real-time dashboard update
```

### Data Accuracy
```bash
# Verify real data display
1. Check booking management shows real bookings
2. Verify metrics match actual data
3. Test search functionality
4. Verify filtering works correctly
5. Check real-time updates work
```

## ðŸš¨ Error Handling Verification
