# Tenant Detail Page - Simplified Tabs

## Changes Made

### ✅ Kept Essential Tabs (5 tabs):

1. **Features** - Configure tenant feature flags and plan overrides
2. **Users** - Manage owner login credentials and user management
3. **Billing** - Subscription, Stripe identifiers & plan details
4. **Security** - API keys, staff accounts, recovery history
5. **Operations** - Background jobs & rate limits (useful for debugging)

### ❌ Removed Non-Essential Tabs (5 tabs):

1. **Usage** - Usage overview, bookings, staff metrics (can add later if needed)
2. **Notes** - Internal notes panel (not critical for MVP)
3. **Audit** - Audit logs (can add back when needed for compliance)
4. **Churn** - Churn signals and analysis (future feature)
5. **Analytics** - Analytics dashboard (was just placeholder)

### 📝 Benefits:

- ✅ **Cleaner interface** - Less clutter, easier to navigate
- ✅ **Faster loading** - Fewer components to render
- ✅ **Focus on essentials** - Core management features only
- ✅ **Better UX** - Less overwhelming for admins
- ✅ **Easier maintenance** - Less code to maintain

### 🔧 Technical Changes:

**File**: `apps/admin-dashboard/src/pages/TenantDetailPage.tsx`

1. Removed 5 `TabsTrigger` components
2. Removed 5 `TabsContent` sections
3. Removed unused component imports:
   - `TenantInternalNotesPanel`
   - `TenantAuditLogPanel`
   - `TenantChurnSignalsPanel`
   - `TenantUsageOverview`
   - `TenantAdoptionSnapshot`

**Lines Changed**: ~50 lines removed

### 📸 Before vs After:

**Before** (10 tabs):
```
Features | Users | Billing | Security | Usage | Operations | Notes | Audit | Churn | Analytics
```

**After** (5 tabs):
```
Features | Users | Billing | Security | Operations
```

### 🚀 Future Enhancements:

If needed, these tabs can be added back later:
- **Analytics** - When you have real analytics data
- **Usage** - For usage-based billing or monitoring
- **Audit** - For compliance requirements
- **Notes** - For internal team communication
- **Churn** - For customer success team

## Verification

After saving:
1. Hard refresh the admin UI (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Go to any tenant detail page
3. Should see only 5 tabs now
4. All tabs should load correctly
5. No console errors

---

## Summary

The tenant detail page now focuses on the **5 core management areas** that admins need for day-to-day operations:

1. **Features** - What the tenant can do
2. **Users** - Who can access it  
3. **Billing** - How they pay
4. **Security** - Keys and access control
5. **Operations** - Health and debugging

This makes the admin interface cleaner and more focused! ✨
