## Issues Encountered

- Some functions failed with `502 Bad Gateway` or `504 Gateway Time-out`
- All successfully deployed on retry
- This is a known Supabase API issue during high load

## Verification

Check deployed functions in Supabase Dashboard:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz/functions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Deploy Audit Logging Migration**
   - Migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251020000000_audit_logging_system.sql`
   - Status: Committed, awaiting deployment via Supabase Dashboard SQL editor
   - See: `docs/AUDIT_LOGGING_DEPLOYMENT.md`

2. ⏳ **Test Edge Functions**
   - Verify each function is callable
   - Check logs for errors
   - Test with React Query hooks

3. ⏳ **Continue Phase 3: React Hooks**
   - Create useAuditLog hooks for client-side integration
   - Create activity logging HOCs

## Function Endpoints

All functions are accessible at:
```
https://kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz.supabase.co/functions/v1/{function-name}
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Log activity
curl -X POST \
  https://kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz.supabase.co/functions/v1/log-activity \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action": "create", "resource_type": "booking"}'

# Query audit logs
curl -X GET \
  'https://kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz.supabase.co/functions/v1/query-audit-logs?limit=10' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN'
```

## Environment Variables

All functions use these environment variables (automatically set by Supabase):
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key for admin operations
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Anonymous key for public operations

## Notes

- All functions use CORS headers from `_shared/cors.ts`
- Service role key is used for bypassing RLS in Edge Functions
- JWT authentication is required for all endpoints
- Tenant isolation is enforced via `auto_provisioning` table

## Monitoring

Monitor function logs and metrics:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Functions section
3. Click on individual functions to see:
   - Invocation logs
   - Error rates
   - Execution times
   - Memory usage

## CLI Version Note

Current CLI version: v2.45.5  
Latest available: v2.51.0

Consider updating:
```bash
scoop update supabase
# or
npm update -g supabase
