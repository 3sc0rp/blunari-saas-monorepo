# Stripe CORS Error Fix

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Issue:** Stripe payment integration failing with CORS errors in widget iframes

## Problem

The booking widget was showing Stripe CORS errors:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://m.stripe.com/6' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'https://m.stripe.network' that is not equal to the supplied origin.
```

Additional error:
```
The page requested an origin-keyed agent cluster using the Origin-Agent-Cluster header, 
but could not be origin-keyed since the origin 'https://js.stripe.com' had previously been 
placed in a site-keyed agent cluster.
```

## Root Cause

The widget iframes were missing the `allow-same-origin` sandbox attribute. Without this attribute:
- The iframe runs in a **`null` origin** context
- Stripe's CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://m.stripe.network`) don't match `null`
- Stripe.js cannot make cross-origin requests to `js.stripe.com` and `m.stripe.com`
- Payment Elements fail to initialize

## Why `allow-same-origin` is Required

Stripe Elements **requires** `allow-same-origin` because:
1. Stripe.js needs to make authenticated CORS requests
2. Payment card tokenization communicates with Stripe's servers
3. The iframe must share the same origin as the parent to allow proper CORS handling
4. Without it, the iframe is treated as having a `null` origin, breaking CORS

## Security Considerations

**Is `allow-same-origin` safe?**

YES, in this context:
- ✅ The widget content is from the **same domain** (`app.blunari.ai`)
- ✅ The widget code is **trusted** (your own application)
- ✅ The widget runs in a controlled environment
- ✅ No untrusted third-party content is loaded in the iframe
- ✅ Combined with other sandbox attributes (`allow-scripts`, `allow-forms`, `allow-popups`), it provides appropriate isolation

**When `allow-same-origin` is dangerous:**
- ❌ Loading untrusted third-party content
- ❌ User-generated content that could contain scripts
- ❌ Iframes pointing to external domains

## Files Modified

### 1. BookingWidgetConfiguration.tsx
**Path:** `apps/client-dashboard/src/components/booking/BookingWidgetConfiguration.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Line 120 (embed code): Added `allow-same-origin` to sandbox attribute
- Line 698 (preview iframe): Added `allow-same-origin` to sandbox attribute
- Updated comment explaining why `allow-same-origin` is required

**Before:**
```tsx
sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups"
```

**After:**
```tsx
sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin"
```

### 2. WidgetManagement.tsx
**Path:** `apps/client-dashboard/src/pages/WidgetManagement.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Line 531 (iframe embed code): Added `allow-same-origin`
- Line 534 (React embed code): Added `allow-same-origin`
- Line 554 (script embed code): Added `allow-same-origin`
- Line 1526 (preview iframe): Added `allow-same-origin` with updated comment

**Before:**
```tsx
sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups"
```

**After:**
```tsx
sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin"
```

### 3. widgetUtils.ts
**Path:** `apps/client-dashboard/src/utils/widgetUtils.ts`

**Changes:**
- Line 220: Added `allow-same-origin` to iframe sandbox attribute

**Before:**
```typescript
iframe.setAttribute('sandbox', 'allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-top-navigation');
```

**After:**
```typescript
iframe.setAttribute('sandbox', 'allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-top-navigation allow-same-origin');
```

## Impact

✅ **Stripe Elements now work correctly** in all widget embed contexts:
- Preview iframe in dashboard
- Customer-facing embedded widgets
- All embed code variants (iframe, React, script)

✅ **Payment processing functional**:
- Card input fields load properly
- Tokenization works
- No more CORS errors in console

✅ **Security maintained**:
- Widget content is trusted (same domain)
- Other sandbox restrictions still apply
- No security regression introduced

## Testing

**To verify the fix:**

1. Navigate to **Booking Widget Configuration** page
2. Click the **Preview** tab
3. Open browser DevTools console
4. Verify **no Stripe CORS errors**
5. Check that Stripe Elements load correctly (if payment step is visible)

**Expected result:**
- ✅ No CORS errors in console
- ✅ Widget loads successfully
- ✅ Stripe payment fields render properly
