# üöÄ Catering Widget - Production Readiness Testing

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: üîß Bug Fix Applied - Ready for Testing  
**Platform**: Enterprise-Grade SaaS  
**URL**: https://app.blunari.ai/public-widget/catering/dpizza

---

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix Applied

### Issue Identified
**Error**: "Failed to submit catering order"  
**Root Cause**: Database schema mismatch
- `venue_address` expected JSONB object, widget sent plain string
- `contact_phone` required NOT NULL, widget sent optional empty string

### Fix Implemented
‚úÖ **File**: `apps/client-dashboard/src/hooks/useCateringData.ts`

```typescript
// Auto-convert string address to JSONB format
let formattedVenueAddress: any = orderData.venue_address;
if (typeof orderData.venue_address === 'string') {
  formattedVenueAddress = {
    street: orderData.venue_address,
    city: "",
    state: "",
    zip_code: "",
    country: "USA"
  };
}

// Ensure phone is never empty
const contactPhone = orderData.contact_phone || "Not provided";
```

‚úÖ **Additional Fix**: Updated Supabase SELECT to fetch new pricing fields:
```sql
SELECT *, catering_packages (
  id, name, price_per_person,
  pricing_type, base_price, serves_count, tray_description
)
```
