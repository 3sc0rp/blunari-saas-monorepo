## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**Database:**
```sql
-- Daily notification reads
SELECT DATE(created_at), COUNT(*) 
FROM notification_reads 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Invitation acceptance rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_sent,
  COUNT(accepted_at) as accepted,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(accepted_at) / COUNT(*), 2) as rate_pct
FROM employee_invitations
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Active employees by role
SELECT role, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE' 
GROUP BY role;
```

**Edge Functions:**
```bash
# View invite-staff logs
npx supabase functions logs invite-staff --project-ref kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz

# View accept-staff-invitation logs
npx supabase functions logs accept-staff-invitation --project-ref kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz
```

---

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback Procedures

### If Issues Arise

**Rollback Edge Functions:**
```bash
npx supabase functions delete invite-staff --project-ref kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz
npx supabase functions delete accept-staff-invitation --project-ref kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz
```

**Rollback Database (notification_reads only):**
```sql
-- Run in SQL Editor
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_unread_notification_count(UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS mark_notification_unread(UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS mark_notifications_read(UUID[], UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS mark_notification_read(UUID, UUID);
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS notification_reads;
```
Frontend will automatically fall back to localStorage-only mode.

**Disable Email Temporarily:**
```bash
npx supabase secrets set EMAIL_ENABLED=false --project-ref kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz
```
Invitation links will be logged to console instead.
