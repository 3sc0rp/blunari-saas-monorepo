# Fix for React Error #31 - Peak Hours Rendering

## Issue
When accessing the Widget tab in the Bookings page, you encountered:
```
Minified React error #31
Objects are not valid as a React child
Error mentions: {hour, bookings}
```

## Root Cause
The Edge Function (`widget-analytics`) returns `peakHours` as an array of objects:
```typescript
peakHours: [
  { hour: 18, bookings: 15 },
  { hour: 19, bookings: 12 }
]
```

But the code was trying to render these objects directly in JSX:
```tsx
{analyticsData.peakHours.map((hour, index) => (
  <Badge>{hour}</Badge>  // ❌ This renders {hour: 18, bookings: 15}
))}
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. TypeScript Type (types.ts)
✅ **FIXED** - Updated type definition to match Edge Function response
```typescript
peakHours?: Array<{ hour: number; bookings: number }> | null;
```

### 2. BookingsTabbed.tsx 
✅ **FIXED** - Updated rendering to extract values
```tsx
{analyticsData.peakHours.map((peakHour, index) => (
  <Badge key={index} variant="secondary">
    {peakHour.hour}:00 ({peakHour.bookings} bookings)
  </Badge>
))}
```

### 3. WidgetManagement.tsx
✅ **FIXED** - Same fix applied

## Next Steps

### If You're Running in Development:
You need to **restart your development server** for the changes to take effect:

```powershell
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it:
cd "c:\Users\Drood\Desktop\Blunari SAAS\apps\client-dashboard"
npm run dev
```

### If You're Running in Production:
The production build has been completed successfully with all fixes. Deploy the new build.

### To Clear Browser Cache:
After restarting, also clear your browser cache:
- **Chrome/Edge:** Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear cached images and files
- **Or:** Hard reload with Ctrl + Shift + R
- **Or:** Open DevTools (F12) → Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## Verification Steps

After restarting the dev server:

1. Navigate to Bookings page
2. Click on "Widget" tab
3. The page should load without errors
4. You should see widget configuration options
5. No "Component Error" should appear

## Files Modified

- ✅ `apps/client-dashboard/src/widgets/management/types.ts`
- ✅ `apps/client-dashboard/src/pages/BookingsTabbed.tsx`
- ✅ `apps/client-dashboard/src/pages/WidgetManagement.tsx`
- ✅ `apps/client-dashboard/src/widgets/management/useWidgetAnalytics.ts` (refresh button fix)

## Build Status

✅ **TypeScript Compilation:** PASSED
✅ **Production Build:** COMPLETED (17.24s)
✅ **Bundle Size:** 715.53 kB main bundle
✅ **No Errors:** All files compiled successfully

## Summary

The error was caused by trying to render JavaScript objects directly in React components. All instances have been fixed by properly extracting the `hour` and `bookings` values from the peakHours array objects.

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Restart dev server to see changes
