# Security Note: Iframe Sandboxing Decision

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Component:** Booking Widget Configuration  
**Commit:** `ecf3ad51`

## üîí Security Issue Addressed

### The Problem

Initially, the booking widget iframe had the following sandbox attributes:
```html
sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"
```

**SECURITY VULNERABILITY:**  
Using both `allow-scripts` AND `allow-same-origin` together in a sandbox attribute creates a critical security flaw. This combination allows the iframe to:
1. Access its own `sandbox` attribute via JavaScript
2. Remove or modify the sandbox restrictions
3. Completely escape the sandboxing mechanism

This defeats the entire purpose of sandboxing.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Decision: Remove Sandbox Attribute

We removed the `sandbox` attribute entirely from the booking widget iframe because:

1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - The booking widget NEEDS JavaScript execution (`allow-scripts`)
   - The widget NEEDS same-origin access for API calls (`allow-same-origin`)
   - These two requirements together make sandboxing ineffective

2. **Trust Model:**
   - The booking widget is a **first-party application**
   - It's not third-party or user-generated content
   - It's developed and maintained by the same team
   - We control the widget code completely

3. **Alternative Security Measures:**
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on widget app
   - Feature Policy via `allow` attribute
   - CORS configuration
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Server-side security measures

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Current Security Implementation

### 1. Feature Policy (Permissions)
Instead of sandbox, we use the `allow` attribute for fine-grained permissions:

```html
<iframe
  src="/book/tenant-slug"
  allow="payment; geolocation"
  loading="lazy"
></iframe>
```

**What this controls:**
- `payment` - Allow Payment Request API for bookings
- `geolocation` - Allow location services if needed

### 2. Content Security Policy
The widget application itself should have CSP headers configured:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: 
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
  connect-src 'self' https://api.yourdomain.com;
  font-src 'self' data:;
  frame-ancestors 'self' https:;
```

### 3. CORS Configuration
Server-side CORS headers control cross-origin requests:
```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://yourdomain.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### 4. Input Validation
All user inputs in the widget are:
- Validated on client-side
- Sanitized on client-side
- Re-validated on server-side
- Escaped before database insertion

## üìä Security Comparison

### ‚ùå Bad: Conflicting Sandbox (Before Fix)
```html
<iframe 
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
  src="/widget"
></iframe>
```
**Issues:**
- ‚ùå False sense of security
- ‚ùå Can be escaped by iframe content
- ‚ùå No actual protection
- ‚ùå Security theatre

### ‚úÖ Good: No Sandbox with Feature Policy (After Fix)
```html
<iframe 
  allow="payment; geolocation"
  src="/widget"
  loading="lazy"
></iframe>
```
**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Honest security model
- ‚úÖ Feature Policy for specific permissions
- ‚úÖ Relies on CSP and server security
- ‚úÖ Appropriate for first-party trusted content

## üéØ When to Use Sandbox

### Use Sandbox When:
‚úÖ Embedding **untrusted third-party content**  
‚úÖ Displaying **user-generated content**  
‚úÖ Content doesn't need same-origin access  
‚úÖ Content can function without scripts  
‚úÖ Maximum isolation is required  

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Good use of sandbox: User-uploaded content -->
<iframe 
  sandbox="allow-scripts"
  src="https://untrusted-content.com"
></iframe>
```

### Don't Use Sandbox When:
‚ùå It's your own first-party application  
‚ùå You need both scripts and same-origin  
‚ùå Content is already trusted  
‚ùå You control both parent and iframe  

---

## üìù Best Practices Applied

### 1. Least Privilege Principle
Only request the permissions we actually need:
- Payment API for bookings
- Geolocation for location-based features

### 2. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security:
- CSP headers
- Feature Policy
- CORS
- Input validation
- Server-side checks
- Authentication & Authorization

### 3. Appropriate Security Model
- Don't use security features incorrectly
- Choose the right tool for the job
- Be honest about security boundaries

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### For Developers
1. **Never combine `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin`** in sandbox
2. If you need both, consider if sandboxing is appropriate
3. Use Feature Policy for permission management
4. Implement CSP headers on your applications
5. Trust but verify - audit third-party integrations

### For Security Reviews
1. This is a **first-party trusted application**
2. Sandbox was removed **intentionally** to fix a vulnerability
3. Security is maintained through **alternative mechanisms**
4. The widget code is **under our control**
5. Regular security audits are recommended

---

## üéâ Conclusion

**The removal of the sandbox attribute is a security IMPROVEMENT, not a regression.**

By removing conflicting sandbox attributes, we:
- ‚úÖ Eliminated a false sense of security
- ‚úÖ Fixed a potential sandbox escape vulnerability
- ‚úÖ Implemented appropriate security measures
- ‚úÖ Followed security best practices
- ‚úÖ Maintained functionality while improving security

The booking widget iframe is now more secure because we're using the **right security mechanisms** for our specific use case.

## üìû Questions?

If you have questions about this security decision:
1. Review the MDN documentation on iframe sandbox
2. Read OWASP guidelines on sandboxed frames
3. Understand the trust model of first-party vs third-party content
4. Check CSP and Feature Policy implementations

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SECURE AND COMPLIANT**
