ON catering_orders(tenant_id, created_at DESC);

-- Index on customer_email for RFM analysis
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_catering_orders_customer_email

-- ============================================================================
-- NOTES
-- ============================================================================

-- These views provide:
-- 1. Revenue forecasting with trend analysis (90-day baseline)
-- 2. Customer segmentation using RFM methodology (7 segments)
-- 3. Package performance with revenue/order percentages
-- 4. Booking patterns by hour, day of week, event type
-- 5. Conversion funnel with stage-by-stage rates
-- 6. Forecasting function with confidence intervals (95% CI)

-- All views respect tenant isolation via base table RLS policies
-- Forecasting uses simple linear regression with seasonal patterns
-- RFM scores use industry-standard buckets (1-5 scale)
-- Conversion rates calculated relative to previous funnel stage
