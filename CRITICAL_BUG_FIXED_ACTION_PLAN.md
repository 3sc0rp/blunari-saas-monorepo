# 🔥 CRITICAL BUG FIXED - Tenant Owner User Reuse

## What Was Wrong

**The tenant-provisioning function was REUSING existing auth users** when the provided email already existed, causing multiple tenants to share the same owner account!

This is why "Warrior Factory" showed `naturevillage2024@gmail.com` instead of `wfactory@gmail.com`.

## What's Fixed Now

✅ **tenant-provisioning deployed** - Now throws error if owner email already exists
✅ **Forces unique owner emails** - Each tenant MUST have its own owner
✅ **No more user sharing** - New tenants will get dedicated owner accounts

## 🎯 What You Need To Do Now

### Step 1: Delete Existing Tenants with Shared Owners

Your current tenants are **sharing the same owner user** (`04d3d2d0-3624-4034-8c75-f363e5965838`). You need to recreate them:

1. **Delete these tenants** from admin dashboard:
   - Warrior Factory
   - Nature Village
   - Test Restaurant (if any others)
   - droodwick (if it's a test tenant)

### Step 2: Recreate Tenants with UNIQUE Emails

For each tenant, use a **DIFFERENT owner email**:

**Tenant 1: Warrior Factory**
- Name: `Warrior Factory`
- Slug: `wfactory`
- **Owner Email**: `wfactory-owner@gmail.com` ← MUST BE UNIQUE!

**Tenant 2: Nature Village**
- Name: `Nature Village`
- Slug: `nature-village`
- **Owner Email**: `nature-owner@gmail.com` ← DIFFERENT EMAIL!

**Tenant 3: droodwick**
- Name: `droodwick`
- Slug: `dpizza`
- **Owner Email**: `dpizza-owner@gmail.com` ← DIFFERENT EMAIL!

### Step 3: Verify Each Tenant Has Own Owner

After recreating, check in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT 
  t.name,
  t.slug,
  t.owner_id,
  p.email as owner_email,
  'Each should have different owner_id and email' as note
FROM tenants t
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON t.owner_id = p.user_id
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC;
```

Expected: **Each tenant has a DIFFERENT owner_id and email** ✅

### Step 4: Test Email Updates

1. Go to any tenant → Manage Credentials
2. Update email to something else
3. Should work without affecting other tenants! ✅

## Why This Matters

**Before Fix**:
- All tenants shared owner: `naturevillage2024@gmail.com`
- Updating one tenant's email broke others
- Login credentials were shared across tenants ❌

**After Fix**:
- Each tenant has own owner: `wfactory-owner@gmail.com`, `nature-owner@gmail.com`, etc.
- Email updates are independent
- Each tenant has separate login credentials ✅

## Important Notes

1. **Owner emails must be UNIQUE** - The system will now reject duplicate emails
2. **Use different emails for each tenant** - Even if they're for the same restaurant chain
3. **Save the generated passwords** - Shown once during tenant creation
4. **Each tenant is completely independent** - No more shared users!

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Delete old tenants with shared owners
- [ ] Recreate Warrior Factory with `wfactory-owner@gmail.com`
- [ ] Recreate Nature Village with `nature-owner@gmail.com`
- [ ] Verify each has different `owner_id` in database
- [ ] Test email update on one tenant
- [ ] Verify other tenants are not affected
- [ ] Login works with each tenant's unique credentials

## Success Criteria

✅ Each tenant shows its own owner email in Login Credentials section
✅ Updating one tenant's email doesn't affect others
✅ Each tenant has unique `owner_id` in database
✅ No more "Unable to update user account" errors

---

**The bug is fixed and deployed!** You just need to recreate your tenants with unique owner emails. 🚀
