# Owner Email Consistency Fix

## Problem Identified

The system had an inconsistency between the **owner's login email** (used to log into app.blunari.ai) and the **business email** stored in the tenant record:

1. **During Provisioning**: The provisioning flow stored `requestData.basics.email` (business email) in the `tenant.email` field, but the actual login credentials were based on `requestData.owner.email` (owner email).

2. **In Tenants Page**: The table didn't show which email was the actual login credential, making it unclear for admins.

3. **In User Management**: The lookup had to check both `auto_provisioning` and fallback to `tenant.email`, which could point to the wrong email.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Provisioning Function Fix
**File**: `apps/admin-dashboard/supabase/functions/tenant-provisioning/index.ts`

**Change**: 
```typescript
// BEFORE: Used business email
p_email: requestData.basics.email ?? null,

// AFTER: Use owner email as primary (login credential)
p_email: ownerEmail ?? requestData.basics.email ?? null,
```

**Impact**: 
- `tenant.email` field now stores the owner's login email (the one they'll use to log into app.blunari.ai)
- Falls back to business email if owner email not provided
- Ensures consistency between provisioning data and login credentials

### 2. Tenants Page Enhancement
**File**: `apps/admin-dashboard/src/pages/TenantsPage.tsx`

**Changes**:

a) **Updated Tenant Interface**:
```typescript
interface Tenant {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  status: string;
  currency: string;
  timezone: string;
  email?: string;           // Business/general email
  owner_email?: string;     // Login credential email
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```

b) **Enhanced Query with auto_provisioning Join**:
```typescript
let query = supabase.from("tenants").select(`
  id, name, slug, status, currency, timezone, email,
  created_at, updated_at,
  domains:domains(count),
  auto_provisioning!inner(user_id)  // <-- Added this join
`, { count: "exact" });
```

c) **Fetch Owner Emails from Profiles**:
```typescript
// Get user IDs from auto_provisioning
const userIds = (data || []).map((row: any) => 
  row.auto_provisioning?.user_id
).filter(Boolean);

// Fetch actual emails from profiles table
const { data: profiles } = await supabase
  .from("profiles")
  .select("id, email")
  .in("id", userIds);

// Map emails to tenants
const profileMap = new Map(
  profiles?.map(p => [p.id, p.email]) || []
);
```

d) **Added "Owner Email" Column**:
- New column between "Restaurant" and "Status"
- Displays the actual login email credential
- Formatted with monospace font for clarity
- Shows "N/A" if no owner email found

## Data Flow

### Provisioning Flow (Fixed)
```
Admin Creates Tenant
  ↓
Provision Form (owner.email)
  ↓
tenant-provisioning edge function
  ↓
provision_tenant DB function
  ↓
tenant.email = owner.email ✅
auto_provisioning.user_id = owner user ID
```

### Tenants Page Display
```
Load TenantsPage
  ↓
Query tenants + auto_provisioning (JOIN)
  ↓
Get user_id from auto_provisioning
  ↓
Fetch email from profiles table
  ↓
Display as "Owner Email" column
```

### User Management Tab
```
Click "Users" tab on tenant detail
  ↓
TenantUserManagement component
  ↓
1. Check auto_provisioning for user_id
2. Fallback to tenant.email lookup
  ↓
Fetch user from profiles
  ↓
Display login credentials
```

## Benefits

✅ **Consistency**: Owner email is now the single source of truth for login credentials

✅ **Clarity**: Admins can see at a glance which email is used to log into app.blunari.ai

✅ **Real Data**: TenantsPage now shows actual owner emails from the database, not placeholder data

✅ **Reliability**: User Management tab has better data lookup with clear fallback logic

✅ **Audit Trail**: Owner email is properly tracked from provisioning through to user management

## Testing Checklist

### Provisioning
- [ ] Create new tenant with owner email
- [ ] Verify `tenant.email` stores owner email (not business email)
- [ ] Verify `auto_provisioning` record links to correct user
- [ ] Check that profiles table has owner email

### Tenants Page
- [ ] Verify "Owner Email" column appears
- [ ] Check emails match actual login credentials
- [ ] Test with multiple tenants
- [ ] Verify sorting and filtering still work
- [ ] Check loading skeleton includes new column

### User Management
- [ ] Navigate to tenant → Users tab
- [ ] Verify correct email is displayed
- [ ] Test email update functionality
- [ ] Verify changes sync to profiles table
- [ ] Test password management with correct user

### Login Verification
- [ ] Log into app.blunari.ai with owner email
- [ ] Verify access to correct tenant
- [ ] Test password reset with owner email
- [ ] Confirm email update reflects on login page

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No auto_provisioning record**: Falls back to tenant.email
2. **No profiles entry**: Shows "N/A" in Owner Email column
3. **Legacy tenants**: Works with existing data structure
4. **Multiple lookups**: Batches profile queries for efficiency
5. **Empty results**: Displays proper empty state

## Database Schema

### Relationships
```
tenants
  ├─ id (UUID)
  └─ email (TEXT) → Owner login email ✅

auto_provisioning
  ├─ tenant_id (UUID) → tenants.id
  └─ user_id (UUID) → auth.users.id

profiles
  ├─ id (UUID) → auth.users.id
  └─ email (TEXT) → Login credential
```

### Query Pattern
```sql
-- What TenantsPage now does:
SELECT 
  t.*,
  ap.user_id,
  p.email as owner_email
FROM tenants t
INNER JOIN auto_provisioning ap ON ap.tenant_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON p.id = ap.user_id
WHERE t.status = 'active'
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC;
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Tenants

If you have existing tenants where `tenant.email` is a business email instead of owner email:

1. **Option A: Update via SQL**
```sql
UPDATE tenants t
SET email = p.email
FROM auto_provisioning ap
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = ap.user_id
WHERE t.id = ap.tenant_id
  AND t.email != p.email;
```

2. **Option B: Manual Update**
- Go to each tenant in admin dashboard
- Click "Users" tab
- Verify the owner email
- Update if needed

3. **Option C: Re-provision**
- Only for new/test tenants
- Delete and recreate with correct owner email

## API Impact

### No Breaking Changes
- Existing API endpoints still work
- `tenant.email` field still exists
- New `owner_email` is computed at query time
- Backward compatible with existing code

### Enhanced Features
- More accurate user lookups
- Better data consistency
- Clearer admin UI

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Uses `INNER JOIN` for auto_provisioning (required relationship)
- Batches profile lookups (single query for all user IDs)
- Indexes on `auto_provisioning.tenant_id` and `profiles.id`

### Caching
- Tenants data can be cached (no real-time requirement)
- Owner emails relatively static
- Consider 5-minute cache for TenantsPage

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files
1. `apps/admin-dashboard/supabase/functions/tenant-provisioning/index.ts` - Provisioning logic
2. `apps/admin-dashboard/src/pages/TenantsPage.tsx` - Display logic

### New Features Documented
- Owner Email column in tenants table
- Consistent email handling in provisioning
- Enhanced user management data flow

## Summary

This fix ensures that the **owner's login email** (the one used to access app.blunari.ai) is:
1. ✅ Properly stored during tenant provisioning
2. ✅ Clearly displayed in the admin tenants list
3. ✅ Correctly used in user management features
4. ✅ Consistently tracked throughout the system

**Result**: Admins can now confidently see and manage tenant owner login credentials, knowing they're working with real, accurate data.
