# âœ… VERCEL CONFIGURATION REBUILT

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: Clean rebuild complete

---

## ðŸ§¹ What Was Removed

All old/corrupted Vercel configuration files:
- âœ… Root `vercel.json` (workaround config for monorepo root)
- âœ… `vercel-build.sh` (custom build script workaround)
- âœ… `.vercelignore` (recreated properly)
- âœ… `apps/admin-dashboard/vercel.json` (old config)
- âœ… `apps/client-dashboard/vercel.json` (corrupted config)
- âœ… `apps/admin-dashboard/.vercel/` (local Vercel project files)
- âœ… `apps/client-dashboard/.vercel/` (local Vercel project files)

---

## ðŸ†• What Was Created

### 1. Client Dashboard (`apps/client-dashboard/vercel.json`)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [...],
  "headers": [...]
}
```

**Key Features:**
- âœ… Vite framework detection
- âœ… Simple `npm run build` command
- âœ… Rewrites for SPA routing + public widget
- âœ… Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- âœ… Cache headers for assets
- âœ… CORS headers for public branding API
- âœ… Widget-specific CSP allowing iframe embedding

### 2. Admin Dashboard (`apps/admin-dashboard/vercel.json`)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [...],
  "headers": [...]
}
```

**Key Features:**
- âœ… Vite framework detection
- âœ… Simple SPA routing
- âœ… Security headers
- âœ… Asset caching

### 3. Root `.vercelignore`

Standard ignore patterns for cleaner deployments:
- node_modules, build outputs, tests, documentation, etc.

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical: Vercel Dashboard Configuration

**YOU MUST SET ROOT DIRECTORY IN VERCEL DASHBOARD**

This is **NOT** a code configuration - it's a Vercel project setting!

### For Client Dashboard Project:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/deewav3s-projects/client-dashboard/settings
2. Navigate to: **Build & Development Settings**
3. Find: **Root Directory**
4. Set to: `apps/client-dashboard`
5. Click: **Save**
6. Redeploy

### For Admin Dashboard Project:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/deewav3s-projects/[admin-dashboard-project]/settings
2. Navigate to: **Build & Development Settings**
3. Find: **Root Directory**
4. Set to: `apps/admin-dashboard` âœ… (ALREADY DONE based on your screenshot!)
5. Click: **Save**
6. Redeploy

## ðŸ“‹ Why This Works

### The Problem (Before)
```
Monorepo Root
â”œâ”€â”€ turbo.json (detected by Vercel, caused Turbo interference)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (workspaces cause hoisting)
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vite/ (hoisted here by npm workspaces)
â””â”€â”€ apps/
    â””â”€â”€ client-dashboard/
        â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
        â””â”€â”€ node_modules/ (vite NOT here - it's hoisted!)
```

**Result**: When Vercel ran `cd apps/client-dashboard && npm run build`, vite was in parent node_modules, not local, causing "command not found".

### The Solution (After Root Directory Set)
```
Vercel starts here: apps/client-dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.json (clean config)
â””â”€â”€ node_modules/
    â””â”€â”€ vite/ (installed locally, no workspace hoisting!)
```

**Result**: Vercel treats `apps/client-dashboard` as the project root. No workspace context, no hoisting, vite installs locally, build succeeds!

## âœ… Deployment Checklist

### Admin Dashboard
- [x] Root Directory set to `apps/admin-dashboard` (done in UI)
- [x] Clean `vercel.json` created
- [ ] Click "Save" in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Redeploy
- [ ] Verify deployment succeeds

### Client Dashboard
- [ ] Root Directory set to `apps/client-dashboard` (DO THIS IN UI!)
- [x] Clean `vercel.json` created
- [ ] Click "Save" in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Redeploy
- [ ] Verify deployment succeeds

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes:**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: Rebuild Vercel configuration with proper monorepo setup"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Set Root Directory for client-dashboard** (if not already done)

3. **Redeploy both projects** (they will auto-deploy on git push if Root Directory is set)

4. **Verify deployments:**
   - Client: https://app.blunari.ai
   - Admin: https://admin.blunari.ai

## ðŸ“š Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/client-dashboard/vercel.json` | Client deployment config |
| `apps/admin-dashboard/vercel.json` | Admin deployment config |
| `.vercelignore` | Files to exclude from deployment |
| `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md` | Detailed technical analysis |

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Expected Outcome

Once Root Directory is set in both Vercel projects:

âœ… **Admin Dashboard**:
- Builds in isolated `apps/admin-dashboard/` directory
- No workspace hoisting
- vite installs locally
- Deployment succeeds
- Accessible at admin.blunari.ai

âœ… **Client Dashboard**:
- Builds in isolated `apps/client-dashboard/` directory
- No workspace hoisting
- vite installs locally
- Deployment succeeds
- Accessible at app.blunari.ai

âœ… **Git Push Workflow**:
- Push to master â†’ Vercel auto-detects changes
- Both projects deploy automatically
- No manual `vercel` CLI commands needed

---

**Status**: Configuration files ready. Waiting for Root Directory to be set in Vercel dashboard! ðŸŽ¯
