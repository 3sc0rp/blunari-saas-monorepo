# 🚨 CRITICAL: VERCEL CONFIGURATION GUIDE

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Turbo.json Has Been Restored

The monorepo NEEDS `turbo.json` for local development. Disabling it breaks all apps!

## ✅ THE CORRECT SOLUTION

You MUST configure Vercel Project Settings to use the Root Directory. This is the ONLY proper way to deploy from a monorepo.

### Step-by-Step: Set Root Directory in Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - URL: https://vercel.com/deewav3s-projects/client-dashboard/settings

2. **Click "General" in Settings**

3. **Find "Root Directory" Section**
   - It's in the "Build & Development Settings" area
   - Currently likely set to: (empty) or `.`

4. **Click "Edit" next to Root Directory**

5. **Enter:** `apps/client-dashboard`

6. **Click "Save"**

7. **Trigger Redeploy**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "..." menu on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - OR just push a new commit

### What This Does

✅ Vercel treats `apps/client-dashboard` as the project root
✅ Only sees files in that directory
✅ Doesn't see `turbo.json` from monorepo root
✅ Uses client-dashboard's own package.json and vercel.json
✅ Builds normally without Turbo interference

## 🔄 Alternative: Use vercel-build.sh (Current Setup)

If you CAN'T or DON'T WANT to set Root Directory, I've created `vercel-build.sh` that:
- Explicitly navigates to apps/client-dashboard
- Installs dependencies there
- Runs vite build directly
- Bypasses Turbo completely

Current `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "bash vercel-build.sh",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/client-dashboard/dist"
}
```

This should work but is NOT the recommended long-term solution.

## 📊 Comparison

### Option A: Root Directory (RECOMMENDED)
✅ Clean and proper
✅ Respects monorepo structure
✅ Turbo works locally
✅ Vercel deployment isolated
✅ Easy to maintain

### Option B: vercel-build.sh (TEMPORARY)
✅ Works without dashboard changes
⚠️ Hacky workaround
⚠️ May break with Vercel updates
⚠️ Harder to debug

## 🎯 Recommendation

**PLEASE SET ROOT DIRECTORY IN VERCEL DASHBOARD**

This is the proper, supported way to deploy from a monorepo. The build script is just a temporary workaround.

## 📝 After Setting Root Directory

Once set, you can:
1. Remove `vercel-build.sh`
2. Simplify root `vercel.json` or delete it
3. Use only `apps/client-dashboard/vercel.json`
4. Everything works cleanly

## 🔍 Verification

After setting Root Directory, check deployment logs for:
- ✅ Working directory: `/vercel/path0` (not `/vercel/path0/apps/client-dashboard`)
- ✅ Finds package.json immediately
- ✅ No turbo.json detected
- ✅ Clean npm install + vite build

## ⏰ Do This Now!

Go to Vercel dashboard and set Root Directory to `apps/client-dashboard`. This will fix all deployment issues permanently!
