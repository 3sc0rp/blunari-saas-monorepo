# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX - Final Solution

## Problem Identified
Vercel was auto-detecting the Turborepo monorepo and running `turbo run build` instead of our custom build commands. This caused module resolution issues where Vite couldn't find its own package.

## Root Cause
```
Error: Command "turbo run build" exited with 1
```

Vercel's auto-detection saw:
- `turbo.json` in root
- Monorepo structure with `apps/`
- Decided to use Turborepo build system
- Ignored our custom `buildCommand` in `vercel.json`

## Solution Applied (Commit: 781a2a9c)

Updated `vercel.json` to:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/client-dashboard && npm install && npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/client-dashboard/dist",
  "installCommand": "echo 'Skip - installing in buildCommand'"
}
```

### Why This Works:
1. **Combined install + build**: Ensures dependencies are installed in the right directory
2. **Explicit directory**: `cd apps/client-dashboard` sets correct working directory
3. **Direct commands**: Bypasses Turbo and runs npm/vite directly
4. **Skip installCommand**: Prevents Vercel from running install in wrong place

## Alternative: Set Root Directory in Vercel Dashboard

If the above doesn't work, you MUST set Root Directory in Vercel:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/deewav3s-projects/client-dashboard/settings
2. General → Root Directory
3. Set to: `apps/client-dashboard`
4. Save and redeploy

This tells Vercel to treat `apps/client-dashboard` as the project root, ignoring the monorepo structure.

## What to Expect Next

The next deployment should:
1. ✅ Run `cd apps/client-dashboard`
2. ✅ Run `npm install` (installs vite and all dependencies)
3. ✅ Run `npx vite build` (builds the project)
4. ✅ Output to `apps/client-dashboard/dist`
5. ✅ Deploy successfully

## Monitor Deployment

Check: https://vercel.com/deewav3s-projects/client-dashboard/deployments

Look for:
- ✅ No "turbo run build" in logs
- ✅ "npm install" completes successfully
- ✅ "npx vite build" runs and completes
- ✅ Build succeeds

## If Still Fails

If you still see "turbo run build" in the logs, it means Vercel is ignoring our config. In that case:

1. **Delete `turbo.json` temporarily** from root (or rename it)
2. Or **set Root Directory** in Vercel dashboard (recommended)
3. Or **create new Vercel project** linked only to `apps/client-dashboard`

## Success Criteria

✅ Build completes without errors
✅ Deployment goes live
✅ App loads at app.blunari.ai
✅ No more "vite: command not found" or "Cannot find package 'vite'" errors
