## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### Option 1: Testing & Integration (RECOMMENDED - 4-8 hours)

**Why this first?**: Before building more features, validate what's deployed actually works in production.

#### A. Test Audit Logging System (2-4 hours)
```bash
# 1. Test Edge Functions directly
curl -X POST https://kbfbbkcaxhzlnbqxwgoz.supabase.co/functions/v1/log-activity \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"test","resource_type":"system","severity":"info"}'

# 2. Verify data in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

# 3. Check automatic triggers work
UPDATE bookings SET status = 'confirmed' WHERE id = 'some_id';
SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE resource_type = 'booking' ORDER BY created_at DESC;

# 4. Test compliance views
SELECT * FROM security_events LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM gdpr_user_data_access WHERE user_id = 'test_user_id';
```

#### B. Test Catering Widget in Production (1-2 hours)
```
URL: https://app.blunari.ai/catering/{your-tenant-slug}

Test:
‚ñ° Package selection works
‚ñ° Form validation works
‚ñ° Order submission succeeds
‚ñ° Auto-save/draft recovery works
‚ñ° Analytics events fire (enable debug: localStorage.setItem('ANALYTICS_DEBUG', 'true'))
```

#### C. Test RBAC System (1-2 hours)
```
‚ñ° Role management interface works
‚ñ° Permission matrix displays correctly
‚ñ° User role assignments save properly
‚ñ° Permission guards block unauthorized access
‚ñ° Check useRoles, usePermissions, useUserRoles hooks work
```

**Outcome**: Confidence in deployed systems before building more features.

---

### Option 2: Complete Week 21-22 Phase 4 - Audit UI Components (8 hours)

**Why**: Complete the audit logging feature with visual components for admin users.

#### Files to Create

**1. `apps/client-dashboard/src/components/audit/AuditLogViewer.tsx` (~400 lines)**
- Table component displaying audit logs
- Filters: user, resource type, action, date range, severity, status
- Real-time updates via React Query auto-refresh
- Export to CSV button (uses `useExportAudit` hook)
- Pagination controls
- Detail modal showing full log entry with old/new values
- Color-coded severity badges (info: blue, warning: yellow, error: red, critical: purple)
- Search bar for quick filtering

**2. `apps/client-dashboard/src/components/audit/ComplianceReports.tsx` (~400 lines)**
- GDPR data access report (uses `gdpr_user_data_access` view)
- SOC2 compliance dashboard
- Security events summary (uses `security_events` view)
- Failed authentication attempts chart
- Date range selector
- Export reports to CSV/PDF
- Activity trend charts (use Recharts library already installed)
- Statistics cards (total logs, by severity, by action type)

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
import { useAuditLogs, useAuditStats, useExportAudit } from '@/hooks/rbac'
import { DataTable } from '@/components/ui/data-table' // shadcn/ui
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge'

export function AuditLogViewer({ tenantId }: { tenantId: string }) {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState<AuditLogFilters>({})
  const { data, isLoading } = useAuditLogs(tenantId, filters)
  const { mutate: exportLogs } = useExportAudit(tenantId)
  
  // Render table with data.logs, filters UI, export button
}
```

**Pages to Add**:
- Update routing in `apps/client-dashboard/src/App.tsx`
- Add menu item in sidebar for "Audit Logs" (admin-only)
- Add menu item for "Compliance Reports" (admin-only)

**Testing**:
```bash
# After creating components
npm run dev:client
# Navigate to /audit-logs and /compliance-reports
# Verify tables load, filters work, export works
```

**Outcome**: Full-featured audit log management for compliance.

### Option 3: Production Readiness & Polish (12-20 hours)

**Why**: Get the platform ready for real customer use.

#### Tasks

**A. Security Audit (4 hours)**
- Review all RLS policies in Supabase Dashboard
- Test tenant isolation (ensure users can't access other tenants' data)
- Audit API endpoints for authentication requirements
- Check for exposed secrets/keys in codebase
- Review CORS policies on Edge Functions
- Test rate limiting on critical endpoints

**B. Performance Optimization (4 hours)**
- Code splitting analysis (Vite build output)
- Lazy load heavy components (catering widget, charts)
- Optimize images and assets
- Review React Query cache strategies
- Database query optimization (check slow queries in Supabase)
- Add indexes where needed

**C. Error Handling & Monitoring (4 hours)**
- Verify Sentry integration captures errors (check `SENTRY_DSN_REFERENCE.md`)
- Add error boundaries to main routes
- Test offline behavior (network failures)
- Add loading skeletons for better UX
- Implement toast notifications for all async operations
- Test error recovery flows

**D. Documentation & Onboarding (4 hours)**
- Update `README.md` files in each app
- Create user guides for:
  - Admin dashboard features
  - Client dashboard features
  - Catering widget setup
  - RBAC management
- API documentation for Edge Functions
- Deployment runbooks for future updates

**E. Final Testing (4 hours)**
- E2E tests with Playwright (if time permits)
- Manual regression testing of all major features
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Accessibility audit (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

**Outcome**: Production-grade platform ready for customers.
