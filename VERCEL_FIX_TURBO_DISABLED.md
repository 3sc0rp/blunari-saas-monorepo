# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - FINAL FIX (Turbo Disabled)

## Issue Identified
Vercel was running `turbo run build` because it detected `turbo.json` in the repository root. This caused module resolution issues where Vite couldn't find itself even though node_modules existed.

Error:
```
client-dashboard:build: Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'vite'
```

The `client-dashboard:build:` prefix in logs confirmed Turbo was running.

## Solution Applied (Commit: a9fb53c7)

**Renamed `turbo.json` â†’ `turbo.json.disabled`**

This prevents Vercel from auto-detecting the Turborepo setup and forces it to use our custom build commands in `vercel.json`.

## Current Configuration

### vercel.json:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/client-dashboard && npm install && npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/client-dashboard/dist",
  "installCommand": "echo 'Skip - installing in buildCommand'"
}
```

### What This Does:
1. Vercel skips Turbo completely (no turbo.json found)
2. Runs: `cd apps/client-dashboard` (correct directory)
3. Runs: `npm install` (installs all dependencies including vite)
4. Runs: `npx vite build` (builds with proper module resolution)
5. Outputs to: `apps/client-dashboard/dist`

## Expected Result

The next deployment should:
- âœ… NO "turbo run build" in logs
- âœ… NO "client-dashboard:build:" prefix
- âœ… npm install completes successfully
- âœ… npx vite build runs and completes
- âœ… Build outputs to dist/
- âœ… Deployment succeeds

## Re-enabling Turbo Later

Once Vercel deployment works, you can re-enable Turbo for local development:

```powershell
# Rename back
mv turbo.json.disabled turbo.json

# But keep using git push for deployments (Vercel will still work)
# Or set Root Directory in Vercel to apps/client-dashboard
```

## Alternative: Set Root Directory (Recommended for Long-term)

Instead of disabling Turbo, you can:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ General
2. Set **Root Directory**: `apps/client-dashboard`
3. Re-enable turbo.json
4. Vercel will only see the client-dashboard, not the monorepo

This way you keep Turbo for local development AND Vercel works.

## Monitor Deployment

Check: https://vercel.com/deewav3s-projects/client-dashboard/deployments

Look for the latest deployment and verify:
- âœ… Plain npm install/build logs (no Turbo prefix)
- âœ… Build completes successfully
- âœ… App deploys to production

## Success!

With Turbo disabled at the Vercel level, your build should now work! ðŸŽ‰
